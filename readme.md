IGNORED 
Means it is a category that shouldn't be considered because it is just moving money from one place to another. Like paying a credit card bill. 
Recurring work payments for internet should be counted as `reimbursements`, and the expense counted as an expense. Larger single purchases should be counted as `work` on the expense and income side so that they don't affect any trends. 

Uncategorizable Debits 
Means the transaction's category didn't fall into any of the available umbrella categories. They need categorization, otherwise they will not be reflected in the final output. Add additional mappings from the uncategory to an existing umbrella. 

Uncategorizable credits
There will be uncategorizable credits in the debug output. That is expected and does not affect total income calculation. There just isn't a need to categorize income categories.

Expense categories are reconciled (debits+credits) and so is the `Net` value. However `Total Outgoing` and `Total Incoming` are unreconciled sums representing the full movement of money.
