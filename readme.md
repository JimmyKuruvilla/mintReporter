IGNORED 
Means it is a category that shouldn't be considered because it is just moving money from one place to another. Like paying a credit card bill. 

Uncategorizable Debits 
Means the transaction's category didn't fall into any of the available umbrella categories. They need categorization, otherwise they will not be reflected in the final output. Add additional mappings from the uncategory to an existing umbrella. 

Uncategorizable credits
There will be uncategorizable credits in the debug output. That is expected and does not affect total income calculation. There just isn't a need to categorize income categories.

Expense categories are reconciled (debits+credits) and so is the `Net` value. However `Total Outgoing` and `Total Incoming` are unreconciled sums representing the full movement of money.
